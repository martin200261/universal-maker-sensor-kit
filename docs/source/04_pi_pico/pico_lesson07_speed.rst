Lesson 07: Infrared Speed Sensor Module
==========================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico W to interface with an infrared speed sensor module. By connecting the sensor to GPIO 16, you will detect obstructions in real-time. The program monitors the sensor output, and when an obstruction is detected, it prints "Obstruction detected" to the console. If there's no obstruction, it prints "Unobstructed."

Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from machine import Pin
   import time
   
   # Set GPIO 16 as an input pin to read the speed sensor
   speed_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
   
   while True:
       if speed_sensor.value() == 1:
           print("Obstruction detected")
       else:
           print("Unobstructed")
   
       time.sleep(0.1)  # Short delay to reduce CPU usage


Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. **Import Libraries**:

   This code begins by importing necessary libraries. The ``machine`` library is used to interact with the GPIO pins, and the ``time`` library is for adding delays in the program.

   .. code-block:: python

      from machine import Pin
      import time

#. **Sensor Configuration**:

   The infrared speed sensor is connected to GPIO 16. It's set as an input, meaning the Pi Pico W will read data from this pin.

   .. code-block:: python

      speed_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)

#. **Main Loop**:

   The ``while True:`` loop creates an infinite loop. Inside this loop, the program continuously checks the sensor's value.
   
   If ``speed_sensor.value()`` is 1, it means the sensor detects an obstruction. If it is 0, then there is no obstruction.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          if speed_sensor.value() == 1:
              print("Obstruction detected")
          else:
              print("Unobstructed")

#. **Delay to Reduce CPU Usage**:

   A short delay of 0.1 seconds is introduced in each iteration of the loop. This reduces the CPU usage by preventing the loop from running too rapidly.

   .. code-block:: python
     
      time.sleep(0.1)

#. **More**

   If an encoder is mounted on the motor, the rotational speed of the motor can be calculated by counting the number of times an obstruction passes the sensor within a specific period.
