Lesson 33: Servo Motor (SG90)
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to control a servo motor (SG90) using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. You will be introduced to the concepts of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for controlling the angle of the servo motor. The lesson includes writing a MicroPython script to make the servo sweep smoothly through its entire range of motion, from 0 to 180 degrees and back.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Importing Modules and Initializing Servo:

   The ``machine`` module is crucial for accessing the PWM functionality needed to control the servo, and ``time`` is used for implementing delays. The servo is initialized on pin 16 of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, setting its frequency to 50Hz, a typical value for servo control.

   .. code-block:: python

      import machine
      import time
      servo = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(16))
      servo.freq(50)

#. Mapping and Servo Control Functions:

   The ``interval_mapping`` function translates the desired servo angle into a PWM pulse width. The ``servo_write`` function then converts this pulse width into a duty cycle, which is used to set the servo's position. These functions are central to converting the angular position into an appropriate PWM signal.

   Please refer to :ref:`Work Pulse <cpn_servo_pulse>` for information about the work pulse of the servo.

   .. code-block:: python

      def interval_mapping(x, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max):
          return (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min

      def servo_write(pin, angle):
          pulse_width = interval_mapping(angle, 0, 180, 0.5, 2.5)
          duty = int(interval_mapping(pulse_width, 0, 20, 0, 65535))
          pin.duty_u16(duty)

#. Main Loop for Continuous Movement:

   The main loop is where the servo is controlled to sweep from 0 to 180 degrees and back. This is achieved by looping through the range of angles and calling ``servo_write`` for each angle, with a short delay to ensure smooth movement.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          for angle in range(180):
              servo_write(servo, angle)
              time.sleep_ms(20)
          for angle in range(180, -1, -1):
              servo_write(servo, angle)
              time.sleep_ms(20)
