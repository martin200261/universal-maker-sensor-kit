Lesson 22: Touch Sensor Module
==================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to connect a touch sensor to the Raspberry Pi Pico W in order to control an onboard LED. By using straightforward Python code, you'll configure the touch sensor as an input device. When the sensor detects a touch, it will send a signal to turn on the LED, providing a visual indication that a touch has been detected. Conversely, when there's no touch, the LED stays off.

Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from machine import Pin
   import time
   
   # Set GPIO 16 as an input pin to read the touch sensor state
   touch_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
   
   # Initialize the onboard LED of the Raspberry Pi Pico W
   led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)
   
   while True:
       if touch_sensor.value() == 1:
           led.value(1)  # Turn on the LED
           print("Touch detected!")
       else:
           led.value(0)  # Turn off the LED
           print("No touch detected")
   
       time.sleep(0.1)  # Short delay to reduce CPU usage


Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. **Setting up the pins**:

   Here, we import necessary libraries and set up GPIO pins. The touch sensor is connected to GPIO 16 as an input, and the onboard LED is configured as an output.

   .. code-block:: python

      from machine import Pin
      import time

      touch_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
      led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)

#. **Main loop and touch detection**:

   In an infinite loop, the code constantly checks the state of the touch sensor. If a touch is detected (value equals 1), the LED is turned on and a message is printed. Otherwise, the LED remains off, and a different message is printed. A short delay is added to reduce CPU usage.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          if touch_sensor.value() == 1:
              led.value(1)  # Turn on the LED
              print("Touch detected!")
          else:
              led.value(0)  # Turn off the LED
              print("No touch detected")

          time.sleep(0.1)  # Short delay to reduce CPU usage
