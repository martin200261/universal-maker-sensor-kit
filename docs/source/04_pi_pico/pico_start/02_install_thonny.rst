Install Thonny IDE
=======================================

Before you can start to program Pico with MicroPython, you need an integrated development environment (IDE), here we recommend Thonny. Thonny comes with Python 3.10 built in, just one simple installer is needed and you're ready to learn programming.


.. note::

    If you already have Thonny installed, make sure it is version 3.3.3 or later, as the Raspberry Pi Pico interpreter is only compatible with these versions; if not, please update or install the appropriate version.

#. You can download it by visiting the |link_thonny| website. Once open the page, you will see a light gray box in the upper right corner, click on the link that applies to your operating system.
