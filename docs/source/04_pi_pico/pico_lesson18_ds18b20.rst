Lesson 18: Temperature Sensor Module (DS18B20)
================================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to integrate and read temperature data from DS18B20 sensors using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. You'll begin by setting up a OneWire bus on the GPIO pin and scanning for DS18X20 devices. The main focus of the lesson is continuously reading and displaying temperature measurements from these sensors.

Code

.. code-block:: python

   from machine import Pin
   import onewire
   import time, ds18x20
   
   # Initialize the OneWire bus on GPIO pin 12
   ow = onewire.OneWire(Pin(12))
   
   # Create a DS18X20 instance using the OneWire bus
   ds = ds18x20.DS18X20(ow)
   
   # Scan for DS18X20 devices on the bus and print their addresses
   roms = ds.scan()
   print('found devices:', roms)
   
   # Continuously read and print temperature data from the sensors
   while True:
       # Start the temperature conversion process
       ds.convert_temp()
       # Wait for the conversion to complete (750 ms for DS18X20)
       time.sleep_ms(750)
       
       # Read and print the temperature from each sensor found on the bus
       for rom in roms:
           print(ds.read_temp(rom))
       
       # Wait for a short period before the next reading (1000 ms)
       time.sleep_ms(1000)



Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Importing Libraries

   The code begins by importing necessary libraries. ``machine`` is used for controlling GPIO pins, ``onewire`` for the OneWire communication protocol, ``ds18x20`` for the specific temperature sensor, and ``time`` for delays.

   Regarding OneWire in MicroPython, you can refer to |link_micropython_onewire_driver|.

   .. code-block:: python

      from machine import Pin
      import onewire
      import time, ds18x20

#. Initializing OneWire Bus

   A OneWire bus is initialized on GPIO pin 12. This sets up the communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the DS18B20 sensor.

   .. code-block:: python

      ow = onewire.OneWire(Pin(12))

#. Creating DS18X20 Instance

   A DS18X20 instance is created using the OneWire bus. This instance is used to interact with the temperature sensor.

   .. code-block:: python

      ds = ds18x20.DS18X20(ow)

#. Scanning for Devices

   The code scans for DS18X20 devices on the OneWire bus and prints their addresses. This is important for identifying the connected sensors.

   .. code-block:: python

      roms = ds.scan()
      print('found devices:', roms)

#. Reading Temperature Data

   - The main loop of the program continuously reads temperature data from the sensor.
   - It starts the temperature conversion process and waits for it to complete, which takes about 750 milliseconds.
   - It then reads and prints the temperature from each sensor found on the bus.
   - The loop pauses for 1000 milliseconds before repeating.
