Lesson 14: Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor Module (MAX30102)
====================================================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico W to interface with the MAX30102 pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor. You will gain knowledge on setting up I2C communication, configuring the sensor, and reading raw data from the sensor. By observing changes in the data, you can obtain heartbeat information.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Setting up I2C Interface

   ``SoftI2C`` is initialized with SDA and SCL pins, and a frequency of 400kHz is set for the communication.

   .. code-block:: python

      from machine import SoftI2C, Pin
      i2c = SoftI2C(sda=Pin(20), scl=Pin(21), freq=400000)

#. Initializing the Sensor

   The MAX30102 sensor is initialized using the I2C interface.
   A scan of the I2C bus is performed to ensure the sensor is connected and recognized.

   For more information about the ``max30102`` library, please visit |link_micropython_max30102_driver|.

   .. code-block:: python

      from max30102 import MAX30102
      sensor = MAX30102(i2c=i2c)

#. Sensor Configuration

   The sensor is configured with default settings for LED mode, ADC range, sample rate, LED power, averaged samples, and pulse width.
   Additional configurations like sample rate, FIFO average, and LED amplitude are set.

   .. code-block:: python

      sensor.setup_sensor()
      sensor.set_sample_rate(400)
      sensor.set_fifo_average(8)
      sensor.set_active_leds_amplitude(MAX30105_PULSE_AMP_MEDIUM)

#. Reading Temperature

   The temperature of the sensor is read and printed.

   .. code-block:: python

      print(sensor.read_temperature())

#. Data Acquisition

   A loop is set up to continuously acquire data from the sensor.
   The ``check()`` method is polled to see if new readings are available.
   Red and IR readings are retrieved from the sensor's storage and printed.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          sensor.check()
          if sensor.available():
              red_reading = sensor.pop_red_from_storage()
              ir_reading = sensor.pop_ir_from_storage()
              print("red_reading",red_reading, "ir_reading", ir_reading)

   Open Plotter in Thonny to observe the heartbeat data.
