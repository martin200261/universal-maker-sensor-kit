Lesson 08: IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module
====================================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico W with an IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module. We'll walk you through setting up the sensor and writing a MicroPython script that continuously reads its value to detect obstacles. By monitoring changes in the sensor data, you'll grasp how to use it for basic obstacle detection.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Wiring
---------------------------

    :width: 100%


Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from machine import Pin
   import time
   
   # Initialize obstacle avoidance sensor connected to pin 16 as input
   obstacle_avoidance_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
   
   while True:
       # Read and print the value of the obstacle avoidance sensor
       print(obstacle_avoidance_sensor.value())
   
       # Wait for 0.1 seconds before the next read
       time.sleep(0.1)


Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Importing Libraries

   The ``machine`` module is imported to interact with the GPIO pins, and the ``time`` module is used for adding delays.

   .. code-block:: python

      from machine import Pin
      import time

#. Setting Up the Sensor
   
   The obstacle avoidance sensor is set up as an input device on GPIO pin 16. The ``Pin.IN`` parameter configures the pin as an input.

   .. code-block:: python

      obstacle_avoidance_sensor = Pin(16, Pin.IN)

#. Reading Sensor Data in a Loop

   The ``while True:`` loop continuously checks the sensor's output. If the sensor detects an obstacle, it returns ``0``, which is printed out. The ``time.sleep(0.1)`` adds a small delay to make the readings more manageable.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          print(obstacle_avoidance_sensor.value())
          time.sleep(0.1)

   .. note:: 
   
      If the sensor is not working properly, adjust the IR transmitter and receiver to make them parallel. Additionally, you can adjust the detection range using the built-in potentiometer.
