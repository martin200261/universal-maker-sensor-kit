Vibration Sensor Module (SW-420)
=====================================

The SW-420 vibration sensor is a module that detects vibrations or shocks on a surface. It can be used for various purposes, such as detecting door knocks, machine malfunctions, car collisions, or alarm systems. It operates within a voltage range of 3.3 V to 5 V and has three peripherals: two LEDs (one for power status and the other for sensor output) and a potentiometer that can be used to control the vibration threshold point.

Pinout
---------------------------
* **VCC**: This is the positive power supply input from the main control. 
* **GND**: Ground connection.
* **DO**: Digital output. During normal operation, the sensor outputs a Logic Low signal. When vibration is detected, the sensor outputs a Logic High signal.

Principle
---------------------------
SW-420 vibration sensor module consists of a SW-420 vibration switch and an LM393 voltage comparator. A SW-420 vibration switch is a device that has a spring and a rod inside a tube. When the switch is exposed to a vibration, the spring touches the rod and closes the circuit. The vibration sensor in the module detects these oscillations and converts them into electrical signals. The LM393 comparator chip then compares these signals with a reference voltage set by the potentiometer. If the amplitude of the signal exceeds this reference voltage, the output of the comparator goes high (1), otherwise it goes low (0).
