A centrifugal pump is a device that can move liquids from one place to another by using a rotating impeller. It can be used to pump water, oil, chemicals, etc. A centrifugal pump has two main parts: a motor and a pump. The motor provides power to the pump and the pump converts the rotational energy into pressure and flow.

Specification
---------------------------

* **Voltage Scope**: DC 3 ~ 4.5V
* **Operating Current**: 120 ~ 180mA
* **Power**: 0.36 ~ 0.91W
* **Max Water Head**: 0.35 ~ 0.55M
* **Max Flow Rate**: 80 ~ 100 L/H
* **Continuous Working Life**: 100 hours
* **Water Fing Grade**: IP68
* **Driving Mode**: DC, Magnetic Driving
* **Material**: Engineering Plastic
* **Outlet Outside Diameter**: 7.8 mm
* **Outlet Inside Diameter**: 6.5 mm
* It is a submersible pump and should be used that way. It tends to heat too much that there's a risk of overheating if you turn it on unsubmerged.
