A TT motor is a type of DC motor that has a gearbox attached to it. The gearbox reduces the speed of the motor and increases its torque. A TT motor is commonly used in applications such as driving wheels, propellers, fans, among others. A TT motor has two wires: a positive wire and a negative wire. The positive wire is usually red and the negative wire is usually black.

A TT DC gearbox motor with a 1:48 gear ratio is used in the product, it comes with 2 x 200mm wires with 0.1‚Äù male connectors that fit into a breadboard. Perfect for plugging into a breadboard or terminal block.

You can power these motors with 3 ~ 6VDC, but of course, they will go a little faster at higher voltages.
