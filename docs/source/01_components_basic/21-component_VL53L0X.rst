The VL53L0X module is an advanced time-of-flight (ToF) ranging sensor that offers highly accurate distance measurement, regardless of the target's color and reflectance. Manufactured by STMicroelectronics, this sensor excels in measuring absolute distances up to 2 meters, making it well-suited for various applications in fields such as robotics, drones, and wearable devices.

Specification
---------------------------
* Supply Voltage: 3.3V or 5V
* PCB Size: 11 x 25mm
* Communication method: I2C
* ToF ranging length: â‰¤2M

Pinout
---------------------------
* **VIN**: This is the power pin. 
* **GND**: Common ground for power and logic.
* **SCL**: I2C clock pin, connect to your microcontrollers I2C clock line.
* **SDA**: I2C data pin, connect to your microcontrollers I2C data line.
* **GPIO1**: Programmable interrupt output. This output is not level-shifted.
* **XSHUT**: This pin is an active-low shutdown input; Driving this pin low puts the sensor into hardware standby. This input is not level-shifted.
