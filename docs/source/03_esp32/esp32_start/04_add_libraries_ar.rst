Install libraries (Important)
======================================

A library is a collection of pre-written code or functions that extend the capabilities of the Arduino IDE. Libraries provide ready-to-use code for various functionalities, allowing you to save time and effort in coding complex features.

Install from Library Manager
------------------------------------

Many libraries are available directly through the Arduino Library Manager. You can access the Library Manager by following these steps:

#. In the **Library Manager**, you can search for the desired library by name or browse through different categories.

   .. note::

      In projects where library installation is required, there will be prompts indicating which libraries to install. Follow the instructions provided, such as "To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for ‚ÄúDHT sensor library‚Äù and install it." Simply search and install the recommended libraries as prompted.
