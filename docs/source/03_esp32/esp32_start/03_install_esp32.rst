Install the ESP32 Board(Important)
===========================================

To program the ESP32 microcontroller, we need to install the ESP32 board package in the Arduino IDE. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

**Install the ESP32 Board**

#. Open the Arduino IDE. Go to **File** and select **Preferences** from the drop-down menu.

#. Congratulations! You have successfully installed the ESP32 board package in the Arduino IDE. 

**Upload the Code**

#. Now, connect the ESP32 WROOM 32E to your computer using a Micro USB cable.

#. Additionally, Arduino 2.0 introduced a new way to quickly select the board and port. For ESP32, it is usually not automatically recognized, so you need to click on **Select other board and port**.
