Lesson 07: Infrared Speed Sensor Module
==========================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to measure rotational speed using a Raspberry Pi and a simple sensor. We'll connect a digital input sensor to GPIO pin 17 and use Python to monitor its state changes. The focus will be on calculating revolutions per second by counting the sensor activations over a specific time period. You'll write a Python function to accurately capture this data and convert it into a measurable speed. This hands-on project is a straightforward yet practical introduction to real-world data collection and analysis with Raspberry Pi, ideal for beginners interested in applied Python programming and hardware interaction.

Required Components

Code

           if current_state and not last_state:
               # Detect a transition from inactive to active state
               steps += 1
           last_state = current_state

       rps = steps / steps_per_revolution
       return rps

   print("Measuring RPS...")

   try:
       while True:
           rps = calculate_rps()  # Default sampling for 1 second

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Safely exit the program when a keyboard interrupt is detected
       pass



Code Analysis
---------------------------


#. Importing Libraries
   
   The script starts by importing ``DigitalInputDevice`` from gpiozero for sensor interaction and ``time`` for time management.

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import DigitalInputDevice
      from time import time

#. Initializing the Sensor
   
   A ``DigitalInputDevice`` object named ``sensor`` is created, connected to GPIO pin 17. This setup assumes that the digital sensor is connected to GPIO17.

   .. code-block:: python

      sensor = DigitalInputDevice(17)

#. Defining the ``calculate_rps`` Function
   
   - This function calculates the Revolutions Per Second (RPS) of a rotating object.
   - ``sample_time`` is the duration in seconds for which the sensor's output is sampled.
   - ``steps_per_revolution`` represents the number of sensor activations per complete revolution.
   - The function uses a while loop to count the number of steps (sensor activations) within the sample time.
   - It detects transitions from inactive to active states and increments the ``steps`` count accordingly.
   - RPS is calculated as the number of steps divided by ``steps_per_revolution``.

          :param sample_time: Sampling time in seconds
          :param steps_per_revolution: Number of steps in each complete revolution
          :return: Revolutions per second
          """
          start_time = time()
          end_time = start_time + sample_time
          steps = 0
          last_state = False
      
          while time() < end_time:
              current_state = sensor.is_active
              if current_state and not last_state:
                  # Detect a transition from inactive to active state
                  steps += 1
              last_state = current_state
      
          # Calculate RPS
          rps = steps / steps_per_revolution
          return rps

#. Running the Main Loop
   
   - The script then enters a continuous loop where it calls ``calculate_rps`` to calculate and print the RPS.
   - The loop runs indefinitely until a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) is detected.
   - A ``try-except`` block is used to handle the interrupt gracefully, allowing for a safe exit.

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
          while True:
              rps = calculate_rps()  # Default sampling for 1 second
              print(f"RPS: {rps}")
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
          pass
