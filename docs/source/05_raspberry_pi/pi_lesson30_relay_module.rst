Lesson 30: Relay Module
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to control a relay module using a Raspberry Pi. You'll learn how to write a simple Python script to turn the relay on and off at one-second intervals. This project is a practical introduction to using GPIO pins for controlling external devices, providing a basic understanding of how relays work in electronic circuits. It's a straightforward and informative exercise, well-suited for beginners starting with Raspberry Pi and hardware control.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from gpiozero import OutputDevice
   from time import sleep

   # Replace with your GPIO pin number
   relay_pin = 17  # Example using GPIO17

   # Initialize relay object
   relay = OutputDevice(relay_pin)

   try:
      while True:
         # Turn on the relay
         relay.on()
         sleep(1)  # Relay remains on for 1 second

         # Turn off the relay
         relay.off()
         sleep(1)  # Relay remains off for 1 second

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
      # Capture Ctrl+C and safely close the program
      relay.off()
      print("Program interrupted by user")


Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Import Libraries
   
   Import the ``gpiozero`` library for GPIO control and the ``time`` library for delays.

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import OutputDevice
      from time import sleep

#. Initialize the Relay
   
   Define the GPIO pin connected to the relay and initialize an ``OutputDevice`` object with that pin.

   .. code-block:: python

      relay_pin = 17  # Example using GPIO17
      relay = OutputDevice(relay_pin)

#. Relay Control in a Loop
   
   The ``while True:`` loop continuously toggles the relay. ``relay.on()`` and ``relay.off()`` are used to control the relay, and ``sleep(1)`` creates a one-second delay between each state.

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
          while True:
              relay.on()
              sleep(1)  # Relay remains on for 1 second
              relay.off()
              sleep(1)  # Relay remains off for 1 second

#. Exception Handling
   
   The ``except`` block captures a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (Ctrl+C). It ensures the relay is turned off and the program exits safely.

   .. code-block:: python

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
          relay.off()
          print("Program interrupted by user")
