For Raspberry Pi
==================================================

Raspberry Pi users, please refer to the following tutorial. This tutorial is based on Raspberry Pi 5 as an example and has been verified on Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5, but may also be applicable to other versions of Raspberry Pi (not guaranteed).

We will program the Raspberry Pi using the ``GPIO Zero`` library in Python, providing simple code examples for each component to help you get started quickly.

The ``GPIO Zero`` library is a remarkable tool in Python designed for interfacing with the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins on a Raspberry Pi. It offers a straightforward and intuitive API, making it exceptionally accessible for beginners in electronics and programming. The library simplifies tasks such as reading sensors, controlling motors, and activating LEDs, allowing for seamless interaction with a wide array of hardware components. Its user-friendly nature encourages experimentation and learning, making it a popular choice in educational environments and DIY projects.
