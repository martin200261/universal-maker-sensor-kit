**Micro SD Card**

Your Raspberry Pi needs an Micro SD card to store all its files and the Raspberry Pi OS. You will need a micro SD card with a capacity of at least 8 GB.

Optional Components
-------------------------

**Screen**

To access the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment, you can connect it to a TV or computer monitor. If the screen includes speakers, audio will be output through them.

**Mouse & Keyboard**

When you use a screen, a USB keyboard and a USB mouse are also needed.

**HDMI**

The Raspberry Pi has HDMI (or Micro HDMI) output ports, which are compatible with the HDMI ports of most modern TVs and computer monitors. If your screen only comes with a DVI or VGA port, you will need to use the corresponding adapter cable.

**Case**

You can place the Raspberry Pi in a case to protect your device. On our official website, we offer related products for sale; you can view or purchase Raspberry Pi cases |link_buy_pi_case|.

**Sound or Earphone**

Most Raspberry Pi models come with a 3.5mm audio port, which can be used when your screen doesn't have built-in speakers or isn't in use. However, it’s important to note that the latest Raspberry Pi 5 doesn’t come with a 3.5mm audio port.
