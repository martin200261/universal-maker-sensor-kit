Lesson 33: Servo Motor (SG90)
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to control a servo motor using a Raspberry Pi. You'll learn how to adjust the servo's pulse width settings for precise control and write a Python script to move the servo to different positions: minimum, middle, and maximum.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from gpiozero import Servo
   from time import sleep
   
   # GPIO pin for the servo
   myGPIO = 17
   
   # Correction factor for the servo
   myCorrection = 0.45
   maxPW = (2.0 + myCorrection) / 1000  # Maximum pulse width
   minPW = (1.0 - myCorrection) / 1000  # Minimum pulse width
   
   # Initialize the servo with adjusted pulse width range
   servo = Servo(myGPIO, min_pulse_width=minPW, max_pulse_width=maxPW)
   
   # Continuously move servo between positions
   while True:
      # Move servo to middle position
      servo.mid()
      print("mid")
      sleep(0.5)

      # Move servo to minimum position
      servo.min()
      print("min")
      sleep(1)

      # Move servo to middle position
      servo.mid()
      print("mid")
      sleep(0.5)

      # Move servo to maximum position
      servo.max()
      print("max")
      sleep(1)


Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Import Libraries
   
   Import the ``Servo`` class from ``gpiozero`` for servo control and ``sleep`` from ``time`` for timing.

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import Servo
      from time import sleep

#. GPIO Pin and Servo Correction Factor
   
   Define the GPIO pin connected to the servo and set a correction factor to calibrate the servo's pulse width range.

   .. code-block:: python

      myGPIO = 17
      myCorrection = 0.45
      maxPW = (2.0 + myCorrection) / 1000
      minPW = (1.0 - myCorrection) / 1000

#. Initialize the Servo
   
   Create a ``Servo`` object with the specified GPIO pin and adjusted pulse width range.

   .. code-block:: python

      servo = Servo(myGPIO, min_pulse_width=minPW, max_pulse_width=maxPW)

#. Move the Servo Continuously
   
   Use a ``while True`` loop to move the servo between its minimum, middle, and maximum positions, printing the current position and pausing between movements.

   .. code-block:: python

      while True:
          servo.mid()
          print("mid")
          sleep(0.5)

          servo.min()
          print("min")
          sleep(1)

          servo.mid()
          print("mid")
          sleep(0.5)

          servo.max()
          print("max")
          sleep(1)
