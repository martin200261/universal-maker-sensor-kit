Lesson 12: PIR Motion Module (HC-SR501)
============================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor with an Arduino Uno. We'll see how the sensor detects movement and sends a signal to the Arduino, which then triggers a response. This project is ideal for beginners as it provides hands-on experience with digital inputs, serial communication, and conditional programming on the Arduino platform.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Setting up the PIR Sensor Pin. The pin for the PIR sensor is defined as pin 2. 

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int pirPin = 2;
      int state = 0;

2. Initializing the PIR Sensor. In the ``setup()`` function, the PIR sensor pin is set as an input. This allows the Arduino to read the state of the PIR sensor.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

3. Reading from the PIR Sensor and Displaying the Results. In the ``loop()`` function, the state of the PIR sensor is continuously read. 

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        state = digitalRead(pirPin);
        if (state == HIGH) {
          Serial.println("Somebody here!");
        } else {
          Serial.println("Monitoring...");
          delay(100);
        }
      }

   If the state is ``HIGH``, meaning motion is detected, a message "Somebody here!" is printed to the serial monitor. Otherwise, "Monitoring..." is printed.
