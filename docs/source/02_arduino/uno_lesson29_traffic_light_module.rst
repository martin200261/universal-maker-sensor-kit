Lesson 29: Traffic Light Module
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Arduino to control a mini LED traffic light. Weâ€™ll cover programming the Arduino Uno to cycle through green, yellow, and red lights, simulating a real traffic signal. This project is ideal for beginners as it provides practical experience in coding light sequences and timing controls on the Arduino platform.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Before any operations, we define constants for the pins where LEDs are connected. This makes our code easier to read and modify.

  .. code-block:: arduino

     const int rledPin = 9;  //red
     const int yledPin = 8;  //yellow
     const int gledPin = 7;  //green

2. Here, we specify the pin modes for our LED pins. They are all set to ``OUTPUT`` because we intend to send voltage to them.

  .. code-block:: arduino

     void setup() {
       pinMode(rledPin, OUTPUT);
       pinMode(yledPin, OUTPUT);
       pinMode(gledPin, OUTPUT);
     }

3. This is where our traffic light cycle logic is implemented. The sequence of operations is:

    * Turn the green LED on for 5 seconds.
    * Blink the yellow LED three times (each blink lasts for 0.5 seconds).
    * Turn the red LED on for 5 seconds.
    
  .. code-block:: arduino

     void loop() {
       digitalWrite(gledPin, HIGH);
       delay(5000);
       digitalWrite(gledPin, LOW);
       
       digitalWrite(yledPin, HIGH);
       delay(500);
       digitalWrite(yledPin, LOW);
       delay(500);
       digitalWrite(yledPin, HIGH);
       delay(500);
       digitalWrite(yledPin, LOW);
       delay(500);
       digitalWrite(yledPin, HIGH);
       delay(500);
       digitalWrite(yledPin, LOW);
       delay(500);
       
       digitalWrite(rledPin, HIGH);
       delay(5000);
       digitalWrite(rledPin, LOW);
     }
