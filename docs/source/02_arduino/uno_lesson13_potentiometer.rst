Lesson 13: Potentiometer Module
==================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to read the analog value of a potentiometer with an Arduino Uno. We'll connect the potentiometer to pin A0 and use the Arduino to measure its value from 0 to 1023. This tutorial will walk you through setting up the circuit, writing code to read the sensor, and displaying the readings on the serial monitor. It's a great project for beginners, providing hands-on experience with analog input and serial communication on the Arduino platform.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. This line of code defines the pin number to which the potentiometer is connected on the Arduino board.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int sensorPin = A0;

#. The ``setup()`` function is a special function in Arduino that is executed only once when the Arduino is powered on or reset. In this project, the ``Serial.begin(9600)`` command initiates serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);  
      }

#. The ``loop()`` function is the main function where the program runs repeatedly. In this function, the ``analogRead()`` function reads the analog value from the potentiometer and prints it to the serial monitor using ``Serial.println()``. The ``delay(50)`` command makes the program wait for 50 milliseconds before taking the next reading.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        Serial.println(analogRead(sensorPin));  
        delay(50);
      }
