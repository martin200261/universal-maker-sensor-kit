Lesson 02: Capacitive Soil Moisture Module
============================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to connect a capacitive soil moisture sensor to an Arduino and interpret its readings. The project includes reading the sensor's analog output with the Arduino and understanding that lower readings indicate higher soil moisture levels. You'll gain practical experience in handling analog input and serial communication with the Arduino by using the provided code as a hands-on example.

Required Components
---------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Defining the sensor pin:

   This line of code declares a constant integer ``sensorPin`` and assigns it the value of ``A0``, which is the analog input pin the sensor is connected to.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int sensorPin = A0;

#. Setup function:

   The ``setup()`` function is executed once when the program starts. It initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate. This setup is necessary for sending data to the serial monitor.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

#. Loop function:

   The ``loop()`` function runs continuously after ``setup()``. It reads the sensor value from pin A0 using ``analogRead()`` and prints this value to the serial monitor. The ``delay(500)`` statement pauses the loop for 500 milliseconds before the next reading, thus controlling the rate of data acquisition.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        Serial.println(analogRead(A0));
        delay(500);
      }
