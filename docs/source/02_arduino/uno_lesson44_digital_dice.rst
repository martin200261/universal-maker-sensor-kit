Lesson 44: Digital Dice
=============================================================


This program simulates a dice roll using an OLED display. 
The simulation is triggered by shaking the vibration switch, causing the display to cycle through numbers 1 to 6, 
akin to rolling a dice. 
The display halts after a short duration, revealing a randomly selected number that represents the dice roll outcome.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

A comprehensive breakdown of the code:

1. Initialization of variables:

   ``vibPin``: Digital pin connected to the vibration sensor.

2. Volatile variables:

   ``rolling``: A volatile flag that indicates the dice's rolling status. It is volatile as it is accessed within both the interrupt service routine and the main program.

3. ``setup()``:

   Configures the vibration sensor's input mode.
   Assigns an interrupt to the sensor to trigger the rollDice function upon state change.
   Initializes the OLED display.

4. ``loop()``:

   Continuously checks if ``rolling`` is true, displaying a random number between 1 and 6 during this state. The rolling ceases if the sensor has been shaken for over 500 milliseconds.

5. ``rollDice()``:

   The interrupt service routine for the vibration sensor. It initiates the dice roll when the sensor is shaken by recording the current time.

6. ``displayNumber()``:

   Displays a selected number on the OLED screen.
