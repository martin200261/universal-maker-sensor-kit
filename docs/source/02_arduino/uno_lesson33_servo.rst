Lesson 33: Servo Motor (SG90)
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Arduino to control a servo motor and make it rotate from 0 to 180 degrees and back. We will cover the usage of the Servo library, defining and using variables for servo control, as well as implementing a for loop for gradual movement. This project is ideal for beginners as it provides hands-on experience with motor control and basic programming principles in Arduino.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Here, the ``Servo`` library is included which allows for easy control of the servo motor. The pin connected to the servo and the initial angle of the servo are also defined.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      #include <Servo.h>
      const int servoPin = 9;  // Define the servo pin
      int angle = 0;           // Initialize the angle variable to 0 degrees
      Servo servo;             // Create a servo object

2. The ``setup()`` function runs once when the Arduino starts. The servo is attached to the defined pin using the ``attach()`` function.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        servo.attach(servoPin);
      }

3. The main loop has two ``for`` loops. The first loop increases the angle from 0 to 180 degrees, and the second loop decreases the angle from 180 to 0 degrees. The ``servo.write(angle)`` command sets the servo to the specified angle. The ``delay(15)`` causes the servo to wait for 15 milliseconds before moving to the next angle, controlling the speed of the scanning movement.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        // scan from 0 to 180 degrees
        for (angle = 0; angle < 180; angle++) {
          servo.write(angle);
          delay(15);
        }
        // now scan back from 180 to 0 degrees
        for (angle = 180; angle > 0; angle--) {
          servo.write(angle);
          delay(15);
        }
      }
